= Dealing with validation problems

This page summarizes the different task (or in general work) validation problems that Gradle reports and provides guidance for fixing them.

[[invalid_use_of_cacheable_transform_annotation]]
== Invalid use of @CacheableTransform

This error indicates that you have annotated a type with `@CacheableTransform` but this annotation only makes sense on artifact transforms types. Therefore, it's a no-op.

The solution is to remove the annotation. For tasks, the annotation to use is `@CacheableTask`.
